<h1>Anonymous FTP Scanner</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

This script is designed to meticulously scan poorly configured webservers, specifically targeting potential vulnerabilities related to anonymous FTP logins. By systematically examining each webserver, the script determines if anonymous FTP login is enabled. If such a vulnerability is detected, the script leverages this weakness to gain access to the server, subsequently granting us authorized entry. This comprehensive scanning approach serves as a means to identify and address security loopholes, ensuring the necessary steps are taken to fortify the server's defenses
